## Crafting
The Iron Mesh is crafted out of four [Iron Bars](minecraft:iron_bars) put in a square.

## Usage
Right-clicking the [Heavy Sieve](excompressum:heavy_sieve) with a mesh will insert it. It can be retrieved by shift-right-clicking the block with an empty hand. The [Auto Sieve](excompressum:auto_sieve) has a slot for the mesh right beneath the input slot. Meshes can also be inserted through automated means.

## Ex Nihilo
In Ex Nihilo Omnia, the Iron Mesh is able to sift through 256 blocks before it breaks. It can also be used inside Omnia's native Sieve blocks.

This item is disabled for Ex Nihilo Adscensio, as the mod adds an Iron Stiffened Mesh itself.
