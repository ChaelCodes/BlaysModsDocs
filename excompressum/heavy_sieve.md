[Title]: Heavy_Sieve
[Icon]: excompressum:heavy_sieve

The **Heavy Sieve** allows sifting of [Compressed Blocks](excompressum:compressed_block) with a small loss. It requires a suitable [mesh](excompressum:iron_mesh) to function.

## Crafting
The Heavy Sieve can be crafted out of any of the Vanilla wood logs and will take on their texture accordingly.

## Usage
Right-clicking the Heavy Sieve with a mesh will insert it. It can be retrieved by shift-right-clicking the block with an empty hand. Once a mesh has been inserted, the sieve can be right clicked with siftable blocks to sift them.

## Ex Nihilo
In Ex Nihilo Omnia, an [Iron Mesh](excompressum:Iron_Mesh) is required to sift blocks. Any lower level mesh will break instantly on use in a Heavy Sieve.

In Ex Nihilo Adscensio, any mesh will work, as meshes in Adscensio have no durability and only split the loot table.
