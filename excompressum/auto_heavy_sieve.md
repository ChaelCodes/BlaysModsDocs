## Crafting
The Auto Heavy Sieve can be crafted out of any Heavy Sieve; however it will not take on its texture.

If a mod adding steel is loaded, it will require steel instead of iron.

## Upgrades
To speed up an Auto Heavy Sieve, one can feed the tiny person inside to make them work faster.
Any food will work; the tastier the food, the more it motivates your sifter to work faster.

Additionally, the mesh used inside the sieve can be enchanted with either Unbreaking, Fortune or Efficiency.
