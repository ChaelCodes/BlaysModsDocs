## Crafting
The Wooden Crucible can be crafted out of any of the Vanilla wood logs and will take on their texture accordingly. The kind of slab used at the bottom of the recipe does not make a difference.

## Usage
Right-click the crucible with a supported material to insert it. It will slowly convert it to water over time.
